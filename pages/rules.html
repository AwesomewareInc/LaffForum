<h1>Rules</h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Act civil.</b></li>
	<li><b>No hate speech;</b> <em>this forum is literally called the fucking Funny Wars forum</em>. You will be ridiculed for this reason before being potentially banned if you break this rule. Either way, this really is not the place for hate against specific groups of people.</li> 
	<li><b>Do not start drama or bring drama in;</b> admins reserve the right to remove content that concerns matters outside of the site. Posts about specific users here or what they've done are canidates for removal.</li>
	<li><b>Don't spam.</b> Nobody likes spam.</li>
	<ul class='indent'>
		<li>Russian bots will be wasting their time, most of the small community here is not interested.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Please don't link to pornography or grotesque images.</b> Your arguments about whether people should learn to look at pornography will go into the void, there are many people here who are simply not interested in being shown grotesque images or porn.</li>
