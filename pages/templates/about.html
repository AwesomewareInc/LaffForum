<h1>About/FAQ</h1>
This is the official forum for discussing Funny Wars and other projects from the team. While those are the main topics, you should expect to be able to use this as a general place for having friendly conversations.
<h3>"other projects from the team"?</h3>
<p>When the Funny Wars team is not working on Funny Wars, we sometimes work on other film/comic projects, such as <em>the Dedede movie</em>. We may choose to make announcements regarding them, and once we do, you are open to discuss them. We understand people may only go here for Funny Wars, and that's fine, but given the inconsistent release schedule of the comic anyways, it's not unusual to expect other projects we do being discussed here.</p>
Another project being announced or developed does not mean it takes priority over Funny Wars; it means that the Funny Wars team isn't really working on the comic anyways, either because we're waiting on something important to be finished or we're taking a break. 
<h3>Why is the layout?</h3>
<p>The fact that we use a forum instead of, say, a Discord server, is kind of a set up for many punchlines in conversations and perhaps even the comic itself; to add to the punchline, it should look like an old forum too. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PhpBB_3.2_Index_page.png'>But actual old/trusted forum software looks horrible,</a> and it's often times insecure, hence the decision to base it off of MySpace/SpaceHey. This layout might not look too much better, but the hope is that it at least looks better then alternatives, and it hopes to be more secure.</p>
<h3>What is the site built on/can I host this myself/can I contribute to the code?</h3>
<p>The Funny Wars forum is based on an in-house software titled "LaffForum" developed by <a href='/user/IoIxD'>Gavin Parker (IoIxD)</a>. The plan is to make it open source when the code is a bit cleaner and more customizable/hostable, but at the moment it is closed source.</p>
<h3>Why can't I upload images?</h3>
<p>Because this is hosted out of my own pocket and the server it's on isn't very expensive. It has 5gb storage left as I'm writing this and I constantly find myself having to find new things to remove from it. Even compressing it like many modern sites do would fill up the storage quicker then I'm willing to deal with. So for the time being, please just use Imgur.</p>
<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>Setting up an email server for contacting us is on the to-do list. In the mean time, this very forum is the best way to do so, or Discord DMs if you know the people on the team.</p>
